## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Primarily was important to me in practising looking at an image and trying to replicate it just by gauging. Also allowed me to practise my arrangements but still had a constant problem of image overflowing out of the div box that I was struggling to fix, and ended up having a workaround. Also gave me a better idea of the biggest problems that I face when doing simple CSS

### Continued development

Need to revisit the adjustments of width and intrinsic vs extrinsic dimensions. Also need to go back and look at how to prevent overflow of images.
